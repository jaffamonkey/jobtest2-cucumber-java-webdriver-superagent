## Assignment

Notes: 
> I time-boxed myself to 4 hours for these tests. 

> The api tests are not as "daisy-chained" as I wanted. 

> For the UI tests, the Gherkin are too granular, mainly down to Java skills (JavaScript and Python are the languages I have more experience with)

### API tests

#### Setup

```
npm install
npm run test:api
```

### UI tests

```
cd tests/cucumber
mvn install
```
