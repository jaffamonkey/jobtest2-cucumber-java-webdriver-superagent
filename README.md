## Assignment

Notes: 
> I time-boxed myself to 4 hours for these tests. 

> The api tests are not as "daisy-chained" as I wanted. 
> No Cucumber scenarios done for API tests, just the test code.

> For the UI tests, the Gherkin are too granular, mainly down to I am not as speedy in Java, as with JavaScript or Python (more recent experience)

### API tests
