## Assignment

Notes: 
> I time-boxed myself to 4 hours for these tests. 

> The api tests are not as "daisy-chained" as I wanted. 
> No Cucumber scenarios done for API tests, just the test code.

> For the UI tests, the Gherkin are too granular, mainly down to Java skill level (JavaScript and Python are the languages I have more recent experience with)

### API tests

#### Setup

```
cd tests/api
npm install
npm run test:api
